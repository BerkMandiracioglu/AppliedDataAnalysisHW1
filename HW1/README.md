The data we are working with comes from multiple sources. The main data source is DBLP, a database of publications from major computer science journals and conferences. A subset of DBLP, which we use in this assignment, is provided to us via a [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kci8joML74tCSzuBbhxtd1ylR4f0dlm6/view). Later on, we enrich the DBLP data with a dataset on conference rankings and with the proceedings of the [NIPS conference](https://nips.cc/) [1] ('proceedings' is another word for the set of papers published at an academic conference).
